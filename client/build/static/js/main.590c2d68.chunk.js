My grandma got onto the topic of how back in the day the hospitals didn\u2019t really have a way of keeping babies identified(I really don\u2019t know how to explain it). She started to talk about how her mother gave birth and she was very sure that she had a baby boy, but she got sent home with a girl, which is my grandma.</p>"},{"title":"Grandma\'s Secrets","author":"Otto Lammi","avatar":"https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/92.jpg","tags":"Memories | Folklore | Father","story":"<p>My grandma (mother\u2019s side) was an incredible lady. I found out years after she died there were a few secrets she was hiding.</p><p>For a little background:</p><ol><li><p>She was born in the USA but both her patents immigrated from Norway</p></li><li><p>She was born in 1910</p></li><li><p>She had 7 children (my mother born when she was 45)</p></li></ol><p>Okay, so she had 3 sisters and as children they were terrified of 2 of their uncles. One of the uncles (Chester) raped one of her sisters (we\u2019ll call her O) but one of the other sisters (R) internalized it more so and developed a hatred towards men. I found pieces of paper in the family bible with notes about what happened and how my grandma never wanted any of her kids or grandkids to name their children Chester. R never married and O married late in life (after 65)</p><p>At 19 she got married. When she talked about him it was always how wonderful he was. But her mother in law was always mean. All the kids hated to visit her. Her husband was atheist when they married and my grandmother was catholic. After they had a few children he became a Christian and insisted they all, as a family, attended a Lutheran church. She said after he became a Christian he was a different man, before he had been stern and heavy handed with the kids and after he was more gentle and patient. At 46 he died of a heart attack and after the funeral my grandma found out she was pregnant with my mom. There were 7 years between my mom and her closest brother. My grandma took night time cleaning jobs to provide for the kids still home. Her eldest was 25 when my mom was born. My mom remembers going for walks with my grandma in the woods every spring (the time of year he died).  When ever my mom or I would ask questions about her wedding she didn\u2019t give very straight answers and would try to change the subject. I always wondered why everyone looked so somber in her wedding pictures, well turns out she was pregnant when they got married and she tried to hide the shame of it till she died. In all her wedding pictures she\u2019s sitting with the bouquet in front of her. I always wondered if her mother in law was so mean because of that situation...</p><p>My mom grew up in some pretty bad situations/houses. She can remember hearing rats in the walls. For most of middle and high school it was just the 2 of them. They moved a lot but didn\u2019t have a car so they never had many things. They had one house that had bed bugs so after cleaning everything, they wall papered the house and all the way down over the baseboards to seal them in (evidently they can hide there).</p><p>She was an incredible cook and baker. Could make a large meal out of very little. She didn\u2019t let my mom help very much because she didn\u2019t have enough to spare if it got messed up, but by the time I came along (she was 82) she figured she had enough so I got to help her make all sorts of things (pies, cakes, cookies, bread, and some Norwegian specialties)</p><p>She never complained about how poor she was, she just made due with what she had.</p><p>She lived with us from around the time I was born until she died at the age of 94 when I was 12. For my 11th birthday she hand wrote a recipe book for me. Her eye sight was getting pretty bad but she did her best. I have family members call me to give them different recipes from that book. It\u2019s worth more to me than any gift anyone could buy.</p><p>Fun facts!</p><p>She used to make blood pudding until she read in the Bible that you aren\u2019t supposed to consume animal blood. (I\u2019m really glad I never had to try that..)</p><p>She loved animals. They had a dog Pal that kept killing their chickens. Grandpa said if he killed another one he was gonna shoot that dog. Grandma tossed the dead chicken in the creek and Pal lived to a good old age!</p><p>She hated snakes, and would chase them with a shovel.</p><p>She ALWAYS scrubbed the floor on her hands and knees. (I remember her doing it at 95)</p><p>She always had molasses cookies in the freezer. She pull a few out each morning, 2 for her to dunk in her coffee, and one for the dog.</p><p>She loved to pull pranks on people! (Especially my dad)</p><p>She hardly watched tv but would usually sit down to watch Jeopardy.</p><p>My brother was easily grossed out so she made sure to say that he should get her gold teeth when she died.</p><p>When she was born they didn\u2019t register her birth certificate right away so they (who ever filed the paperwork) put the wrong year on it and misspelled her name.  This caused issues with getting her death certificate</p></div></p>"},{"title":"That Time I was Nearly Kidnapped","author":"Blanca Mora","avatar":"https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/75.jpg","tags":"Memories | Folklore | Father","story":"<p>Was talking about family stories on a prorevenge post and figured I\'d start sharing some other ones to. No recipe with this one, but this is another story that my mom and dad bring up at family functions a lot. When I was a baby, my parents were doing a lot of travelling, they did this before I was born as well, it was just something that they\'ve always enjoyed. I enjoyed our extended road trips too, they were a lot of fun.However, when I was about 2, and still a toddler, we were on a road trip to Boston. This was a road trip where we started in Minnesota, our home state at the time and swooped over to Boston before going south a few states and then work our way back up to Minnesota. Since I was so little and my parents don\'t believe on child leashes, they had me on a little harness that my dad wore, so that I was riding on his back and still able to look around. Now according to just about everyone, I was a quiet and adorable baby. I had outgrown the bad sleeping schedule that being born with Jaundice caused (I had needles poked into my feet every two hours and it wrecked my baby sleeping time). So I was happy and curious and looking and waving at everyone. Mom and dad were in a park and there was a backless bench that my dad straddled, so I wasn\'t squished and he was able to face my mom while he drank from a water bottle. Mom and dad were chatting about where they were going to stop on the trip for that day or if they\'d just enjoy the city for a while. While they were talking my dad felt an unfamiliar shift in the carrier I was in. There was a lady trying to lift me from my harness, thankfully I was all clipped in so she just ended up lifting the whole harness that was attached to my dad. My dad began yelling but my mom... My mom was scary. She does this thing when she gets super angry. She gets quiet, and just begins to talk with a cold anger in her voice, demanding to know just what she thought she was doing. The woman began talking about how a young and happy couple like my mom and dad deserve some alone time and she\'d just watch me for a few hours to give them exactly that. That did not fly and my dad stood up to his full height of 6\'3 and he\'s always done weight lifting so he didn\'t need to speak to be intimidating, but he was already yelling, and my mom marched up to her and threatened to call the police. That made the strange lady run the hell away. Mom and dad gave me extra love and made sure that to not leave me alone for a single second the entire trip.</p>"},{"title":"My Tough Situation","author":"Romane Henry","avatar":"https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/44.jpg","tags":"Memories | Folklore | Father","story":"<p>This happened years ago, so my mind might be a little bit foggy, but I\'ll try and tell you readers the details.</p><p>When I was a little kid, I had 3 of my cousins over at my house in Oswego (a little town in Aurora). All of my cousins were on my dad\u2019s side. Let\'s call them Michael, Jackson, and Bo. Bo was the oldest, Jackson was the second oldest, and Michael was a year older than me. Bo and Michael were brothers. All 3 of them can do all sorts of flips and tricks whenever they are around me. They can do front and backflips off of 1 story buildings, bunk beds, the works. And I really wanted to do stuff like that. Now keep in mind that Bo and Jackson were huge troublemakers and good liars because whenever they come to my house, they always like to get each other in trouble, but mostly get me in HUGE trouble. But hey, that\u2019s life. Now that you a little bit about my cousins, on with the story.</p><p>So this happened when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It was a summer day with me on the couch, eating ice cream, watching my favorite shows, the good life. Meanwhile, all of my cousins were in the basement (the basement was underneath the house. The entrance to it was in the kitchen) working out, listening to loud music. After a few minutes passed, I was still watching tv, my cousins came up from the basement and into the kitchen. They were scavenging the fridge to get something to eat because they felt like it. I decided to find something to eat too, so I got off the couch and walked to the kitchen. There were some cookies that were on the table my mom bought from the story 2 days ago before the incident. I grabbed some and went back into the living room. At that moment, stuff gets really dangerous.</p><p>When I sat back on the couch, for some reason, Bo was arguing with Michael because Bo saw something good in Michael\u2019s hand that Michael was going to eat. My mind is still foggy, but I think the conservation went something like this, \u201cGive me that back, bro! I\'m not playing!\u201d Michael said. Bo replied, \u201cHell no! Find something else to eat! I\'m the oldest!\u201d Then Jackson joined in. \u201cAy, y\u2019all stop that! Y\u2019all gonna get us in trouble!\u201d Not me, I said in my head. This kept going on until one of them started throwing hands. I got bored and decided to watch this Wrestlemania event take action. They kept going and going and I tried to hold in all the laughter that was trying to escape from me. While the fight was still going on, I heard a glass break in the kitchen. To me, I thought it came from a show that I was watching on tv and that we would live happily ever after. Sadly, no. It turned out to be one of my mom\u2019s wine glasses she had stored in the cabinets. I guessed one of them must\u2019ve bump into a wall nearby and the glass must\u2019ve tipped over and fell. And to make things worse, my parents weren\u2019t home when this whole royal rumble took place. Now me being the dummy in the house, my dumb ass done went to the kitchen to see what happened because I was nosy. Next thing you know, my cousins ran back down to the basement and acted like they didn\u2019t do anything after hearing my parents unlocking the door. When the door opened and my mom entered the kitchen, <strong>all hell broke loose.</strong></p><p>My mother\u2019s roars were like a dragon\u2019s firey breath that could wipe out an entire village with just one blast. While being confused as hell, my dad decided to cosign. It went like this, Dad: \u201cWhat is this?!\u201d Me: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Dad: \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! (my dad does not tolerate lying) Why did you break this?\u201d He was holding a piece of my mom\u2019s wine glass in his hand. I was standing there, motionlessly. I was speechless throughout the whole conservation and I was sweating my brains out. A few seconds later, the Three Stooges came into the scene. They were asking what happened and saw the broken glass on the floor. Bo and Michael were like \u201cVic, why\u2019d do that?\u201d while they were holding in their laughs. It came to me. I fell for the oldest trick in the book. When I came into the kitchen to see what broke, they knew who to blame it on. This pissed me off because they knew that I would be dumb enough to fall for stuff like this. I really wanted to beat the hell out of them. But when the darkest hour came, my dad told Bo to go grab his belt. This terrified me. I was scared of my dad\u2019s belt because it was a weapon made from the Whooping Gods. Now, whenever you get in trouble, let\u2019s say it was something small that you did, you have two choices: 1. You either go to your room, serve you time (2-3 hours) and wait there until your parents tell you to come on out. Or 2. Get one or two licks to the hand (It\u2019s when you hold out your hand and the parents smacks it hard with the belt). After that, it\u2019s over, done deal, don\u2019t do it again. Plain and simple. But an incident like this, the whooping master decides your fate.</p><p>Before the judgement was going to be said, my dad asked me again, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I told him the same answer while quivering with fear of the mighty belt, \u201cI-I didn\u2019t do it..\u201d My father wasn\u2019t having it. He was furious. He sighed and told me to turn around and don\u2019t move. This was it, my final day. I was in tears, praying for somebody to save me. I thought my life was going to end right there to a swing of a belt, but then came my savior, Jackson. When my dad was about to unleash the beast, Jackson told the whole story. He told him EVERYTHING. He even told my dad that he was trying to tell them to stop fighting and didn\u2019t listen. After that, I was free. The heavens were singing for me as my butt lived another day. A few minutes later, my dad was about to release the beast onto the 3 blind mice, but I told my dad to leave Jackson out of it. Jackson got off scott free, Bo and Michael got what they deserved, and I got a sweet, sweet show to enjoy watching. After that, Bo and Michael wanted to fight Jackson for what he did. But hey, it\'s a family thing. And I can still remember that to this day.</p>"},{"title":"My Great Great Grandpa","author":"Isabella Hill","avatar":"https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/82.jpg","tags":"Memories | Folklore | Father","story":"<p>I don\u2019t know a lot about my family, but I know my great great grandpa was from Italy and he traveled al around the world to practice medicine: when he came back to Italy, they said he was a witch and they were going to hang him.

However, it is one of the times where I was just so scared that my brain shut down, so I don\'t remember it very well.</p><p></p><p>From what my parents and brother have told me it was like this. We were on the tail end of a month long road trip, driving through Colorado on our way back home, when we had to stop for the night. Hotels were full, so we ended up renting an apartment for the night. My brother and I were excited since we each got our own room. The three rooms were connected by a common area with a kitchen area and a living room space, and it seemed relatively nice. At the very least much nicer than the motel 6\'s that we\'d been staying at for the most part. The main common area was connected to the hallway that connected to the other apartments on the floor.</p><p></p><p>I specifically remember half watching an episode of Spongebob with my little brother while reading a book that I had bought earlier in the trip. Then there were a lot of bangs outside and my parents were acting really weird. This is when my memory kinda becomes fuzzy. My brother and I have about a five year age difference, and with me being in my early teens he was probably around seven or eight. He says that mom looked horrified and ushered us into our parents bathroom and made us both lay down in their Jacuzzi style bathtub. He said that I was a good big sis and stuck myself between the door and him, and kept trying to distract him with stupid jokes.</p><p></p><p>Mom said they put us in there because the banging was on the walls of the hallway, though neither my brother or I were really aware of that there was someone banging on the doors of each apartment and trying to get in. Dad had camping equipment that he had brought in his suitcase, and got some of it out in case they got in, but luckily no one ever did.</p><p></p><p>The next thing I remember was waking up in the tub, hugging my brother and a cop talking to our parents. Everything else was fine, and we got the hell out of there that night.</p><p></p><p>I didn\'t really know the details of what happened until about a year ago when we were talking about the worst hotels we\'ve ever been to.</p><p></p><p>Mom and dad are glad my brain wasn\'t on record. My little brother said he was glad that I was there to keep him calm as possible. Dad said that there were 3 new bullet holes in the hallway when we left, and we\'ll never ever go back into that town ever again.</p></div>"},{"title":"The Doctor","author":"Julia Korpela","avatar":"https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/43.jpg","tags":"Memories | Folklore | Father","story":"<p>When my five-year-old daughter came down with a virus, I took her to the doctor\u2019s office.
